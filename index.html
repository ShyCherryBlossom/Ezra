                        He was born on March 21, 2020 at 12:35 pm at 4 lb and 3 oz.
                        <br>Things weren't so good afterwards, for he developed Hypothermia and other issues and
                        was then taken away from his family not long after being born.
                        <br>He spent three days at Robert Packer and was transferred to the Arnot NICU.
                        <br>There he spent about two weeks before being discharged; finally he is with his family.
                        <br>A month goes by, he's finally one month old. He spends his time mainly sleeping and eating.
                        <br>He was eating every 3-4 hours and wasn't allowed to sleep through the night like he wanted-doctor's orders.
                        <br>He was underweight and we begone the jounrey of getting his weight up, slowly by surely his weight got him there going from 4lb to about 10lb,<br>
                        lot of up and downs for him and the parents as they struggle with the sleep/eating schedule.
                        <br>At this point in time Ezra didn't eat good but also was harder for him as he had no cleft palate
                        so we had to used special bottles and it took sometime a hour to even feed him all his bottle.
